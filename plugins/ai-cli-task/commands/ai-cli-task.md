```

- **Dot-prefixed** files are system-managed; `.target.md` and `.plan.md` are human-editable via the Plan annotation panel
- `.plan.md` is the implementation plan file, generated by `plan --generate` and editable through the Plan panel
- `.tmp-annotations.json`, `.auto-signal`, and `.auto-stop` are ephemeral (should be in `.gitignore`)
- `.notes/` files use origin suffix: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<summary>-plan.md` or `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<summary>-exec.md`
- `.test/` files use phase prefix: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<phase>-criteria.md` (test plan) or `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<phase>-results.md` (test outcomes)
- `.summary.md` is a condensed context file — written by `plan`/`check`/`exec` after each run, read by subsequent steps instead of all history files. Prevents context window overflow as task accumulates history
- Each history directory (`.analysis/`, `.test/`, `.bugfix/`, `.notes/`) contains a `.summary.md` that condenses all entries in that directory. **Overwritten** (not appended) each time a new entry is added to the directory. The task-level `.summary.md` integrates from these directory summaries rather than reading every individual file
- Global directories (`.experiences/`, `.references/`) also contain a `.summary.md` index — skills read it first to find relevant files by keyword, avoiding full directory scans

### .summary.md Format

`.summary.md` is overwritten (not appended) on each write. Recommended structure:

```markdown
# Task Summary: <title>

**Status**: <status> | **Phase**: <phase> | **Progress**: <completed_steps>/<total_steps>

## Plan Overview
<!-- 3-5 sentence summary of the implementation approach -->

## Current State
<!-- What was last done, what's next -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important architectural/design decisions made so far -->

## Known Issues
<!-- Active issues, blockers, or risks -->

## Lessons Learned
<!-- Patterns, workarounds, or discoveries from execution -->
```

Writers should keep `.summary.md` under ~200 lines. It is a context window optimization — not a full record (that's `.report.md`).

### Global Directory .summary.md Format

`.experiences/.summary.md` and `.references/.summary.md` serve as keyword indexes for fast file discovery. Overwritten on each new entry.

**Top-level `.experiences/.summary.md`** — indexes all type directories:

```markdown
# Experiences Index

| Type | Tasks | Keywords | Updated |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| software | 5 | testing, API design, error handling | 2024-01-15 |
| dsp | 2 | FFT, audio filters, sample rate | 2024-01-20 |
```

**Per-type `.experiences/<type>/.summary.md`** — condensed summary of all experiences for that type:

```markdown
# software Experiences

## Key Patterns
- [Distilled recurring patterns across all completed tasks]

## Entries

| Module | Date | Key Learnings |
|--------|------|---------------|
| task-api-v2 | 2024-01-15 | REST versioning headers, Bull queue |
| task-auth | 2024-01-10 | JWT rotation, timing-safe compare |
```

**`.references/.summary.md`** — same table format as before:

```markdown
# References Index

| File | Domain/Topic | Keywords | Updated |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| express-middleware.md | backend | routing, middleware chain | 2024-01-15 |
```

Skills read the relevant `.summary.md` first, match keywords against their current task requirements, then drill into matched files. This avoids reading all files in the directory.

Topic filenames in `.references/` use kebab-case: `[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*` (e.g., `express-middleware.md`, `ffmpeg-filters.md`). No uppercase, no underscores, no dots (except the `.md` extension).

### .index.json Schema

```json
{
  "title": "Human-readable task title",
  "type": "",
  "status": "draft",
  "phase": "",
  "completed_steps": 0,
  "created": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updated": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "depends_on": [],
  "tags": [],
  "branch": "task/module-name",
  "worktree": ".worktrees/task-module-name"
}
```

Notes: `worktree` is empty string `""` if not using worktree. `depends_on` entries can be simple strings (require `complete`) or objects `{ "module": "...", "min_status": "..." }`.

#### Type Field

The `type` field identifies the task's domain. It is **auto-discovered** by `research` during the first `plan` phase — `init` does not accept a `--type` argument. All subsequent sub-commands (`check`, `exec`) read this field to adapt their behavior.

**Type format**: Single type (`software`) or pipe-separated hybrid (`data-pipeline|ml`). Parsing: `type.split('|')` → `[0]` is primary, `[1:]` are secondary domains.

**Seed types**: Predefined types are maintained in `init/references/seed-types/` directory (one file per type, with `.summary.md` index, ordered by scope broadest→most specialized) and used to initialize `AiTasks/.type-registry.md` on first `init`. Each per-type file contains Phase Intelligence (plan/verify/check/exec methodology). The registry is auto-expanded by `research` when new domains are discovered. See `init/references/seed-types/.summary.md` for the full index (14 seed files covering 19 types: software, science:*, documentation, data-pipeline, infrastructure, ml, ai-skill, image-processing, video-production, dsp, literary, screenwriting, mechatronics, chip-design).

Scientific research types follow [arXiv taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy) — use `science:<domain>` for unlisted fields (e.g., `science:astro`, `science:neuro`, `science:materials`).

**Auto-discovery**: Type is determined automatically by `research` during the first `plan` phase (see `plan/references/type-profiling.md`). Research analyzes `.target.md` + web search to identify the domain, detects hybrid indicators, and writes the type to `.index.json`. No user input is needed — `init` creates tasks with `type: ""`, which `research` fills in.

**Auto-expanding registry**: `AiTasks/.type-registry.md` holds all known types (seed + dynamically discovered). When `research` identifies a domain not in the registry, it appends a new row automatically. The predefined table above is a **seed**, not a ceiling — new domains are registered on demand.

**Hybrid types**: Tasks spanning multiple domains use pipe-separated format (e.g., `data-pipeline|ml`). The first segment is primary (drives architecture), subsequent segments are secondary (add domain-specific verification and implementation concerns). All phases read experience files and apply methodology for **all** segments.

**Type profile**: Every task module gets a `.type-profile.md` during planning. This file is the **authoritative** domain methodology source for the task — all phases (verify, check, exec) read it first, before falling back to static reference tables. The profile is updated progressively as research/verify/check/exec discover new domain information.

**Type field validation**: Each pipe-separated segment must match `[a-zA-Z0-9_:-]+`. Full type field regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9_:|-]+`. `plan` MUST validate before writing to `.index.json`. `report` MUST validate before using as `.experiences/<type>/` directory name to prevent path traversal.

**Directory-safe transform**: When using a type segment as a directory name (e.g., `.experiences/<segment>/`, `.type-profiles/<segment>.md`), replace `:` with `-` (e.g., `science:astro` → `science-astro`). The original type value in `.index.json` is unchanged.

**Unknown type handling**: When `check` or `exec` encounters a `type` value not matching any known domain in the reference tables, it reads `.type-profile.md` for task-specific methodology. If `.type-profile.md` also doesn't exist (legacy task), it falls back to `software` methodology and records a warning in `.analysis/` (check) or `.notes/` (exec).

#### Phase Field

The `phase` field disambiguates sub-states within a status, primarily for `re-planning` auto recovery:

| Status | Phase | Meaning | Auto Entry Action |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `re-planning` | `needs-plan` | check REPLAN set status, plan hasn't run yet | `plan --generate` |
| `re-planning` | `needs-check` | plan regenerated, ready for assessment | `verify` → `check --checkpoint post-plan` |
| (other) | `""` (empty) | No sub-state needed | Status-based routing |

Writers: `check` sets `phase: needs-plan` on REPLAN and on NEEDS_REVISION when status is `re-planning`. `plan` sets `phase: needs-check` when completing on `re-planning` status. `annotate` sets `phase: needs-check` when the new status is `re-planning` (same rule as `plan`). All other transitions clear `phase` to `""`.

### Status State Machine

| Status | Description | Transitions To |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `draft` | Task target being defined | `planning`, `cancelled` |
| `planning` | Plan being researched | `review`, `blocked`, `cancelled` |
| `review` | Plan passed assessment | `executing`, `re-planning`, `cancelled` |
| `executing` | Implementation in progress | `complete`, `re-planning`, `blocked`, `cancelled` |
| `re-planning` | Plan being revised | `review`, `blocked`, `cancelled` |
| `complete` | Finished and verified | — (terminal) |
| `blocked` | Blocked by dependency/issue | `planning`, `cancelled` |
| `cancelled` | Abandoned (via `cancel`) | — (terminal) |

### Complete State × Command Matrix

Every (state, sub-command) combination. `→X` = transitions to X. `=` = stays same. `⊘` = rejected (prerequisite fail). `—` = no status change.

| State ↓ \ Command → | plan | annotate | check post-plan | check mid-exec | check post-exec | exec | merge | report | cancel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `draft` | →`planning` | →`planning` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — | →`cancelled` |
| `planning` | =`planning` | =`planning` | PASS→`review` / NEEDS_REVISION=`planning` / BLOCKED→`blocked` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — | →`cancelled` |
| `review` | →`re-planning` | →`re-planning` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | →`executing` | ⊘ | — | →`cancelled` |
| `executing` | →`re-planning` | →`re-planning` | ⊘ | CONT=`executing` / NEEDS_FIX=`executing` / REPLAN→`re-planning` / BLOCKED→`blocked` | ACCEPT=`executing` (signal→merge) / NEEDS_FIX=`executing` / REPLAN→`re-planning` | =`executing` (NEEDS_FIX fix) / →`blocked` (dependency) | →`complete` / =`executing` (conflict) | — | →`cancelled` |
| `re-planning` | =`re-planning` | =`re-planning` | PASS→`review` / NEEDS_REVISION=`re-planning` / BLOCKED→`blocked` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — | →`cancelled` |
| `complete` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — (write) | ⊘ |
| `blocked` | →`planning` | →`planning` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — (write) | →`cancelled` |
| `cancelled` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — (write) | ⊘ |

**Legend:** `→X` transition, `=X` self-loop (stays same status), `⊘` rejected, `—` no status change.

**Verification properties:**
- Every non-terminal state has ≥1 exit path (no deadlock)
- Terminal states: only `complete` and `cancelled`
- `cancel` is available on all non-terminal states (rejected on `complete` and `cancelled`)
- `exec` requires `review` gate (cannot skip `check`)
- `merge` requires ACCEPT verdict gate (cannot skip `check post-exec`)
- `re-planning` must pass through `check` to reach `review`
- NEEDS_FIX/NEEDS_REVISION self-loops are broken by auto signal routing (`next` field)

### Annotation Format (for `annotate` sub-command)

`.tmp-annotations.json` contains four `string[][]` arrays:

```json
{
  "Insert Annotations": [["Line{N}:...before20", "content", "after20..."]],
  "Delete Annotations": [["Line{N}:...before20", "selected", "after20..."]],
  "Replace Annotations": [["Line{N}:...before20", "selected", "replacement", "after20..."]],
  "Comment Annotations": [["Line{N}:...before20", "selected", "comment", "after20..."]]
}
```

| Type | Elements | Structure |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Insert | 3 | [context_before, content, context_after] |
| Delete | 3 | [context_before, selected_text, context_after] |
| Replace | 4 | [context_before, selected_text, replacement, context_after] |
| Comment | 4 | [context_before, selected_text, comment, context_after] |

Context: `context_before` = `"Line{N}:...{≤20 chars}"`, newlines as `↵`. `context_after` = `"{≤20 chars}..."`.

### depends_on Format

Supports two formats — simple string (require `complete`) and object (custom minimum status):

```json
{
  "depends_on": [
    "auth-refactor",
    { "module": "api-design", "min_status": "review" }
  ]
}
```

Simple string `"auth-refactor"` → `AiTasks/auth-refactor`, requires status `complete`.

Extended object `{ "module", "min_status" }` → requires the dependency to be at **or past** `min_status` in the state machine progression: `draft` < `planning` < `review` < `executing` < `complete`. Status `blocked`, `re-planning`, `cancelled` do not satisfy any `min_status`.

**Dependency enforcement**: `exec` and `merge` MUST validate that all `depends_on` modules meet their required status before proceeding. If any dependency is not met, the sub-command rejects with a clear error listing the blocking dependencies and their current statuses. `check` also flags unmet dependencies as a blocking issue.

### Git Integration

Every task module has a dedicated git branch. Worktrees are optional for parallel execution.

#### Branch Convention

| Item | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Branch name | `task/<module-name>` | `task/auth-refactor` |
| Worktree path | `.worktrees/task-<module-name>` | `.worktrees/task-auth-refactor` |

#### Commit Message Convention

All ai-cli-task triggered commits use `--` prefix to distinguish from user manual commits:

```
-- ai-cli-task(<module>):<type> <description>
```

| type | Scenario | Commit Scope |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `init` | Task initialization | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `plan` | Plan generation | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `check` | Check evaluation results | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `research` | Reference collection | AiTasks/.references/ files |
| `verify` | Test execution and verification | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `annotate` | Annotation processing | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `summarize` | Context summary regeneration | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `exec` | Execution state changes | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `feat` | New feature code during exec | Project files |
| `fix` | Bugfix code during exec | Project files |
| `refactor` | Code cleanup before merge | Project files |
| `merge` | Merge to main + conflict resolution | — (merge commit) |
| `report` | Report generation | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `cancel` | Task cancellation | AiTasks/ directory files |

Examples:
```
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):init initialize task module
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):plan generate implementation plan
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):research collect references
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):check post-plan PASS → review
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):feat add user auth middleware
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):fix fix token expiration check
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):exec step 2/5 done
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):check post-exec ACCEPT
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):refactor cleanup before merge
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):merge merge completed task
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):merge resolve merge conflict
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):merge task completed
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):report generate completion report
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):verify full verification
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):annotate annotations processed
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):summarize regenerate context summary
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):cancel user cancelled
```

Commit scope: AiTasks/ directory files (state/plan) or project files (feat/fix).

#### Refactoring & Merge

After task completion confirmed (`check --checkpoint post-exec` ACCEPT), the `merge` sub-command handles the full merge lifecycle:

1. **Task-level refactoring** (on task branch, before merge)
2. **Merge to main** (with conflict resolution — up to 3 attempts with verification)
3. **Cleanup** (worktree removal, branch deletion)

See `skills/merge/SKILL.md` for detailed merge strategy and conflict resolution flow.

**Recommended:** After all related tasks merge to main, do a project-level refactoring pass on main (cross-task cleanup, shared utilities, API consistency). This is a manual activity, not part of auto mode.

#### Worktree Parallel Execution

Without `--worktree`: all work happens on the task branch in the main worktree. Only one task can execute at a time (branch switching required).

With `--worktree` (passed to `init`):
```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/task-<module> -b task/<module>
```

- Each task runs in an isolated directory with full project copy
- Multiple tasks can `exec` simultaneously without conflict
- `auto` daemon operates in the task's worktree directory
- On completion, merge back: `git merge task/<module>` from main branch

#### Rollback

To revert a task to a previous checkpoint:
```bash
git log --oneline task/<module>    # find checkpoint commit
git reset --hard <commit>          # in the task's worktree
```

**Warning**: `git reset --hard` is irreversible — all uncommitted changes are lost. Only use in the task's dedicated worktree, never in the main worktree (which may contain other work). Consider `git stash` first if unsure.

#### .auto-signal Convention

Every sub-command that participates in the automation loop (plan, check, exec, merge, report, research, verify, annotate) MUST write `.auto-signal` on completion, regardless of whether auto mode is active. Utility sub-commands (list, summarize) do NOT write `.auto-signal`:

```json
{
  "step": "<sub-command>",
  "result": "<outcome>",
  "next": "<next sub-command or (stop)>",
  "checkpoint": "<checkpoint hint for next command, optional>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>"
}
```

- The `next` field follows the signal routing table documented in the `auto` sub-command.
- The `checkpoint` field provides context for the next command (e.g., `"post-plan"`, `"mid-exec"`, `"post-exec"`) when the `next` command needs it. Optional — omit when not applicable. If auto mode is not active, the file is harmless (gitignored, ephemeral). This fire-and-forget pattern avoids each skill needing to detect auto mode.
- **Atomic write**: `.auto-signal` MUST be written atomically — write to `.auto-signal.tmp` first, then `rename` to `.auto-signal`. POSIX `rename` is atomic, preventing the daemon from reading partially written JSON.

**Worktree note**: In worktree mode, `.auto-signal` MUST be written to the **main worktree's** `AiTasks/<module>/` directory (not the task worktree copy) to survive worktree removal during merge cleanup.

#### .gitignore

Add to project `.gitignore`:
```
.worktrees/
AiTasks/**/.tmp-annotations.json
AiTasks/**/.auto-signal
AiTasks/**/.auto-signal.tmp
AiTasks/**/.auto-stop
AiTasks/**/.lock
AiTasks/.experiences/.lock
AiTasks/.references/.lock
AiTasks/.type-profiles/.lock
```

### Computation Rule

**No mental math.** When ANY sub-command involves numerical reasoning — performance estimates, size calculations, capacity limits, threshold comparisons, algorithm parameters, benchmarks, option evaluation — write a script and run it in shell instead of computing mentally. Scripts produce verifiable, reproducible results.

---

## Input Validation

All sub-commands that accept `<task_module>` MUST validate the path before processing:

| Check | Rule | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Path containment** | Resolved path must be under `AiTasks/` directory (no `..` traversal) | `AiTasks/../etc/passwd` → REJECT |
| **Module name** | Must match `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` (ASCII letters/digits/hyphens/underscores only) | `auth-refactor` ✓, `../../foo` ✗ |
| **No symlinks** | Task module directory must not be a symlink (prevent symlink-based escape) | REJECT if `lstat` ≠ `stat` |
| **Existence** | Directory must exist (except for `init` which creates it) | REJECT if missing |

Validation is performed by resolving the absolute path and confirming it starts with the project's `AiTasks/` prefix. This prevents path traversal attacks where a crafted module name could read/write files outside the task directory.

### Concurrency Protection

Without worktree mode, only one task should be actively operated at a time. Sub-commands that modify state (`plan`, `exec`, `check`, `merge`) MUST check for an active lockfile (`AiTasks/<module>/.lock`) before proceeding:

1. **Acquire**: Attempt to create `AiTasks/<module>/.lock` with `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` (atomic create-if-not-exists). Write `{ session, pid, timestamp }` to identify the holder
2. **If lock exists**: Read lock content, check if holding process is still alive (kill -0). If dead → remove stale lock and retry. If alive → REJECT with error identifying the holding session. No retry — the caller (user or auto) decides whether to retry
3. **Release**: Delete `.lock` on sub-command completion (including error paths)
4. **Worktree mode**: Lock not required — each worktree has its own copy of AiTasks/ files
5. **Stale lock recovery**: Use rename-based recovery instead of delete+create. When detecting a stale lock (holder dead): `rename` the stale `.lock` to `.lock.stale.<pid>`, then acquire normally with `O_CREAT | O_EXCL`. If the rename fails (another process already recovered), retry from step 1. Clean up ALL `.lock.stale.*` files in the same directory immediately after successful lock acquisition

### .experiences/ Write Protection

`AiTasks/.experiences/<type>/` is a shared resource across tasks. When `report` writes to it (experience distillation), it MUST acquire `AiTasks/.experiences/.lock` before any write. This prevents concurrent task completions from corrupting shared files. For hybrid types (`A|B`), `report` writes to directories for **all** pipe-separated segments (e.g., both `A/` and `B/`). Lock scope covers: creating type directory, writing `<module>.md`, updating per-type `.summary.md`, and updating top-level `.summary.md`.

### .references/ Write Protection

`AiTasks/.references/<topic>.md` is a shared resource across tasks. The `research` sub-command is the primary writer (invoked by `plan` or standalone). When any sub-command (`research`, `exec`) writes to `.references/`, it MUST acquire `AiTasks/.references/.lock` using the same lock protocol above. This prevents concurrent tasks from corrupting the reference files.

### .index.json Corruption Recovery

If `.index.json` fails to parse (malformed JSON), sub-commands MUST attempt recovery before failing:

1. **Git recovery**: `git show HEAD:AiTasks/<module>/.index.json` — restore from latest committed version
2. **If git recovery fails**: Reconstruct minimal `.index.json` with `"status": "draft"`, `"phase": ""`, preserve only what's parseable
3. **Log**: Record corruption event and recovery action in `.analysis/<date>-index-recovery.md`

### .type-profiles/ Write Protection

`AiTasks/.type-profiles/<type>.md` is a shared resource across tasks. When `research` or `report` writes to it, they MUST acquire `AiTasks/.type-profiles/.lock` using the same lock protocol above. This prevents concurrent tasks from corrupting shared type profiles.

### Lifecycle Hooks (Extension Point)

Status transitions can optionally trigger external notifications. If `AiTasks/.hooks.md` exists, sub-commands read it for hook configuration:

```markdown
# Lifecycle Hooks

## on_complete
<!-- Shell command or URL to call when any task reaches `complete` -->
<!-- e.g., curl -X POST https://slack.webhook/... -d '{"text":"Task ${MODULE} completed"}' -->

## on_blocked
<!-- Notification when a task becomes blocked -->
```

Hooks are **best-effort** — failures are logged but do not block the status transition. This is an optional extension; the system works without `AiTasks/.hooks.md`.

## Sub-commands

> Each sub-command's core logic is in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Reference material is in `skills/<name>/references/` and loaded on demand.

### Skill File Structure

```
skills/<name>/
├── SKILL.md                # Core logic: steps, state transitions, signals, git
└── references/             # On-demand reference material (loaded when needed)
    └── *.md                # Domain guidelines, annotation processing, audit frameworks, etc.
```

Per-type seed methodology files are centralized in `skills/init/references/seed-types/` (one file per type, with `.summary.md` index). Each per-type file contains Phase Intelligence for all 4 lifecycle phases (plan/verify/check/exec), structured to mirror `.type-profile.md`.

**Main SKILL.md** contains the workflow: prerequisites, execution steps, state transitions, git conventions, `.auto-signal` definitions, and notes. It should be self-sufficient for understanding the sub-command's behavior.

**references/** contains large reference tables and domain-specific details that are only needed in specific situations. The main SKILL.md references these files with `See references/<file>.md` directives — Claude reads them on demand when the context requires it.

### init

`/moonview:init <module_name> [--title "..."] [--tags t1,t2] [--worktree]`

Create task module directory + `.index.json` (status `draft`, type empty) + `.target.md` template. Create git branch `task/<module_name>`, checkout to it (or create worktree with `--worktree`). Type is auto-discovered by `research` during planning. Module name: ASCII letters/digits/hyphens/underscores (`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`).

### plan

```
/moonview:plan <task_module> --generate
```

Research codebase + `.target.md` → write implementation plan to `.plan.md` → status `planning`. Annotation processing is handled by the `annotate` sub-command.

### research

`/moonview:research <task_module> [--scope full|gap] [--caller plan|verify|check|exec]`

Collect and organize external domain knowledge into `AiTasks/.references/`, perform type discovery & refinement, and build `.type-profile.md`. Acts as the intelligence arm of the task lifecycle — separating research from other phases for clearer logic. Two scopes: `full` (comprehensive, first plan) and `gap` (incremental, fill missing topics). `--caller` specifies the invoking phase (default `plan`), directing collection focus and `.auto-signal` routing. Status-neutral — does not change task status. Invoked automatically from multiple phases: `plan` (first plan → `--scope full`, re-plan → `--scope gap`), `verify`/`check`/`exec` (when missing domain knowledge → `--scope gap --caller <phase>`), or standalone for preparatory/supplementary research.

### check

`/moonview:check <task_module> [--checkpoint post-plan|mid-exec|post-exec]`

Decision maker at three lifecycle checkpoints:

| Checkpoint | Prerequisite | Outcomes |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **post-plan** | `planning` / `re-planning` | PASS→`review`, NEEDS_REVISION (no change), BLOCKED→`blocked` |
| **mid-exec** | `executing` | CONTINUE (no change), NEEDS_FIX (no change), REPLAN→`re-planning`, BLOCKED→`blocked` |
| **post-exec** | `executing` | ACCEPT (no change, signal→`merge`), NEEDS_FIX (no change), REPLAN→`re-planning` |

ACCEPT signals → `merge` sub-command for refactoring + merge. Tests MUST pass for ACCEPT.

### verify

`/moonview:verify <task_module> [--checkpoint quick|full|step-N]`

Run domain-adapted tests and verification procedures, producing structured result files in `.test/`. Does not render verdicts — that is `check`'s responsibility. Three checkpoint scopes: `quick` (build + lint + type check), `full` (all criteria + acceptance + regression), `step-N` (criteria for step N only). Status-neutral — does not change task status. Can be invoked standalone or internally by `check`/`exec`.

### exec

`/moonview:exec <task_module> [--step N]`

Execute implementation plan step-by-step. Prerequisite: status `review` or `executing` (NEEDS_FIX continuation). Reads `.plan.md` + `.analysis/` + `.test/`, implements changes, verifies per step against `.test/` criteria. On significant issues → signal `(mid-exec)` for mid-exec evaluation. On all steps complete → signal `(done)` for post-exec verification. Project file commits use `feat`/`fix` type.

### merge

`/moonview:merge <task_module>`

Merge completed task branch to main with automated conflict resolution. Prerequisite: status `executing` with ACCEPT verdict. Performs pre-merge refactoring, attempts merge (up to 3 conflict resolution retries with build/test verification), post-merge cleanup (worktree + branch). On persistent conflict → stays `executing` (retryable after manual resolution).

### report

`/moonview:report <task_module> [--format full|summary]`

Generate `.report.md` from all task artifacts. Informational only — no status change. For `complete` tasks, includes change history via commit message pattern matching (works after branch deletion). Full format: Summary, Objective, Plan, Changes, Verification, Issues, Dependencies, Lessons.

### auto

`/moonview:auto <task_module> [--start|--stop|--status]`

Single-session autonomous loop: plan → verify → check → exec → verify → check(mid) → exec → verify → check(post) → merge → report, with self-correction. A single Claude session internally orchestrates all steps; the backend daemon monitors progress via `fs.watch` on `.auto-signal` and enforces safety limits.

**Status-based first entry:**

| Status | First Action |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Validate `.target.md` has content → plan --generate (stop if empty) |
| `planning` | verify → check --checkpoint post-plan |
| `re-planning` | Read `phase`: `needs-plan` → plan --generate; `needs-check` → verify → check --checkpoint post-plan; empty → plan --generate (safe default) |
| `review` | exec |
| `executing` | verify → check --checkpoint post-exec |
| `complete` | report → stop |
| `blocked` / `cancelled` | stop |

**Signal-based subsequent routing** (`next` field breaks self-loops):

| step | result | next | checkpoint |
|------|--------|------|------------|
| check | PASS | exec | — |
| check | NEEDS_REVISION | plan | — |
| check | CONTINUE | exec | — |
| check | ACCEPT | merge | — |
| check | NEEDS_FIX | exec | mid-exec / post-exec |
| check | REPLAN / BLOCKED | plan / (stop) | — |
| plan | (any) | verify | post-plan |
| exec | (done) | verify | post-exec |
| exec | (mid-exec) | verify | mid-exec |
| exec | (step-N) | verify | mid-exec | ← manual `--step N` only |
| exec | (blocked) | (stop) | — |
| research | (collected)/(sufficient) | `<caller>` (plan/verify/check/exec) | post-research |
| verify | (pass/fail/partial) | check | — |
| annotate | (processed) | verify | post-plan |
| merge | success | report | — |
| merge | conflict | (stop) | — |
| report | (any) | (stop) | — |

**Safety**: max iterations (default 20), timeout (default 30 min), stop on `blocked`, one auto per session (SQLite PK), one auto per task (UNIQUE).

### cancel

`/moonview:cancel <task_module> [--reason "..."] [--cleanup]`

Cancel any non-terminal task → `cancelled`. Rejected on `complete`/`cancelled`. Stops auto if running. Snapshots uncommitted changes before cancelling. With `--cleanup`, removes worktree + deletes branch. Without `--cleanup`, branch preserved for reference.

### list

```
/moonview:list [<task_module>] [--deps] [--timeline]
```

Read-only task query. Without arguments: summary table of all tasks. With `<task_module>`: single task details. With `--deps`: Mermaid dependency graph. With `--timeline <module>`: status transition timeline from git history. Pure read-only — no files written, no status changes, no git commits, no `.auto-signal`.

### annotate

```
/moonview:annotate <task_file_path> <annotation_file_path> [--silent]
```

Process `.tmp-annotations.json` from the Plan panel (Insert/Delete/Replace/Comment) with cross-impact assessment (None/Low/Medium/High) → update task file → delete annotation file. Comments add `> 💬`/`> 📝` blockquotes, never modify existing content. REJECT on `complete`/`cancelled`. State transitions mirror `plan`: `draft`→`planning`, `review`/`executing`→`re-planning`, `blocked`→`planning`.

### summarize

`/moonview:summarize <task_module> [--all]`

Regenerate `.summary.md` for context recovery or refresh. Reads all task artifacts (`.index.json`, `.target.md`, `.plan.md`, `.analysis/`, `.bugfix/`, `.test/`, `.notes/`) and produces a condensed summary. With `--all`, also regenerates each sub-directory's `.summary.md`. Status-neutral — does not change task status. No `.auto-signal` (maintenance tool, not part of auto loop).
