```

- **Dot-prefixed** files are system-managed; only `.target.md` is human-editable
- **Non-dot** `.md` files are user-authored plan documents via the Plan annotation panel
- `.tmp-annotations.json`, `.auto-signal`, and `.auto-stop` are ephemeral (should be in `.gitignore`)
- `.notes/` files use origin suffix: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<summary>-plan.md` or `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<summary>-exec.md`
- `.test/` files use phase prefix: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<phase>-criteria.md` (test plan) or `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<phase>-results.md` (test outcomes)
- `.summary.md` is a condensed context file — written by `plan`/`check`/`exec` after each run, read by subsequent steps instead of all history files. Prevents context window overflow as task accumulates history
- Each history directory (`.analysis/`, `.test/`, `.bugfix/`, `.notes/`) contains a `summary.md` that condenses all entries in that directory. **Overwritten** (not appended) each time a new entry is added to the directory. The task-level `.summary.md` integrates from these directory summaries rather than reading every individual file

### .summary.md Format

`.summary.md` is overwritten (not appended) on each write. Recommended structure:

```markdown
# Task Summary: <title>

**Status**: <status> | **Phase**: <phase> | **Progress**: <completed_steps>/<total_steps>

## Plan Overview
<!-- 3-5 sentence summary of the implementation approach -->

## Current State
<!-- What was last done, what's next -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important architectural/design decisions made so far -->

## Known Issues
<!-- Active issues, blockers, or risks -->

## Lessons Learned
<!-- Patterns, workarounds, or discoveries from execution -->
```

Writers should keep `.summary.md` under ~200 lines. It is a context window optimization — not a full record (that's `.report.md`).

#### Type Field

The `type` field identifies the task's domain, set by `plan` (generate mode) after analyzing `.target.md`. All subsequent sub-commands (`check`, `exec`) read this field to adapt their behavior.

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `software` | Programming, API, database, UI development | Web app, CLI tool, library |
| `image-processing` | Image/video manipulation, rendering, visual | Filters, thumbnails, format conversion |
| `video-production` | Video editing, compositing, VFX, motion graphics | Non-linear editing, color grading, visual effects, titling |
| `dsp` | Digital signal processing, audio, frequency analysis | FFT, audio filters, spectrum analysis |
| `data-pipeline` | Data transformation, ETL, migration | CSV processing, DB migration, data cleaning |
| `infrastructure` | DevOps, deployment, CI/CD, containers | Docker setup, deploy scripts, monitoring |
| `documentation` | Docs, README, translation, content | API docs, user guides, i18n |
| `ml` | Machine learning, model training, datasets | Model fine-tuning, data labeling, evaluation |
| `literary` | Fiction, poetry, creative writing, essays | Novel chapters, poetry collections, literary criticism |
| `screenwriting` | Film/TV scripts, storyboards, dialogue | Feature scripts, episode scripts, scene breakdowns |
| `science:physics` | Physics research and simulation | Mechanics, optics, quantum, astrophysics, condensed matter |
| `science:chemistry` | Chemical research, molecular modeling | Synthesis routes, reaction kinetics, molecular dynamics |
| `science:biology` | Biological research, bioinformatics | Genomics, proteomics, phylogenetics, systems biology |
| `science:medicine` | Medical/pharmaceutical research | Drug discovery, clinical data analysis, pharmacokinetics |
| `science:math` | Mathematics, statistics, formal proofs | Theorem proving, numerical analysis, statistical modeling |
| `science:econ` | Economics, quantitative finance | Econometrics, market modeling, risk analysis |
| `mechatronics` | Embedded systems, robotics, PLC, control systems | Motor control, PID tuning, sensor integration, SCADA |
| `ai-skill` | AI skill/plugin/agent/prompt development | Claude Code skills, MCP servers, prompt engineering, agent workflows |
| (custom) | Any domain not listed above | Must match `[a-zA-Z0-9_:-]+` (e.g., `robotics`, `game-design`) |

Scientific research types follow [arXiv taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy) — use `science:<domain>` for unlisted fields (e.g., `science:astro`, `science:neuro`, `science:materials`).

Type is determined once during planning and persists throughout the task lifecycle. If a re-plan changes the task's nature, `plan` may update the type.

**Type field validation**: Custom type values must match `[a-zA-Z0-9_:-]+` — no spaces, path separators, or dots. `init` (from `--type` argument) and `plan` MUST validate before writing to `.index.md`. `report` MUST validate before using as `.experience/<type>.md` filename to prevent path traversal.

**Unknown type fallback**: When `check` or `exec` encounters a `type` value not matching any known domain in the reference tables, it falls back to `software` methodology and records a warning in `.analysis/` (check) or `.notes/` (exec): `"Unknown type '<value>', falling back to software methodology"`. This ensures the pipeline never blocks on an unrecognized type.

#### Phase Field

The `phase` field disambiguates sub-states within a status, primarily for `re-planning` auto recovery:

| Status | Phase | Meaning | Auto Entry Action |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `re-planning` | `needs-plan` | check REPLAN set status, plan hasn't run yet | `plan --generate` |
| `re-planning` | `needs-check` | plan regenerated, ready for assessment | `check --checkpoint post-plan` |
| (other) | `""` (empty) | No sub-state needed | Status-based routing |

Writers: `check` sets `phase: needs-plan` on REPLAN. `plan` sets `phase: needs-check` when completing on `re-planning` status. All other transitions clear `phase` to `""`.

### Status State Machine

| Status | Description | Transitions To |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `draft` | Task target being defined | `planning`, `cancelled` |
| `planning` | Plan being researched | `review`, `blocked`, `cancelled` |
| `review` | Plan passed assessment | `executing`, `re-planning`, `cancelled` |
| `executing` | Implementation in progress | `complete`, `re-planning`, `blocked`, `cancelled` |
| `re-planning` | Plan being revised | `review`, `blocked`, `cancelled` |
| `complete` | Finished and verified | — (terminal) |
| `blocked` | Blocked by dependency/issue | `planning`, `cancelled` |
| `cancelled` | Abandoned (via `cancel`) | — (terminal) |

### Complete State × Command Matrix

Every (state, sub-command) combination. `→X` = transitions to X. `=` = stays same. `⊘` = rejected (prerequisite fail). `—` = no status change.

| State ↓ \ Command → | plan | check post-plan | check mid-exec | check post-exec | exec | merge | report | cancel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `draft` | →`planning` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — | →`cancelled` |
| `planning` | =`planning` | PASS→`review` / NEEDS_REVISION=`planning` / BLOCKED→`blocked` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — | →`cancelled` |
| `review` | →`re-planning` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | →`executing` | ⊘ | — | →`cancelled` |
| `executing` | →`re-planning` | ⊘ | CONT=`executing` / NEEDS_FIX=`executing` / REPLAN→`re-planning` / BLOCKED→`blocked` | ACCEPT=`executing` (signal→merge) / NEEDS_FIX=`executing` / REPLAN→`re-planning` | =`executing` (NEEDS_FIX fix) / →`blocked` (dependency) | →`complete` / =`executing` (conflict) | — | →`cancelled` |
| `re-planning` | =`re-planning` | PASS→`review` / NEEDS_REVISION=`re-planning` / BLOCKED→`blocked` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — | →`cancelled` |
| `complete` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — (write) | ⊘ |
| `blocked` | →`planning` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — (write) | →`cancelled` |
| `cancelled` | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | ⊘ | — (write) | ⊘ |

**Legend:** `→X` transition, `=X` self-loop (stays same status), `⊘` rejected, `—` no status change.

**Verification properties:**
- Every non-terminal state has ≥1 exit path (no deadlock)
- Terminal states: only `complete` and `cancelled`
- `cancel` is available on all non-terminal states (rejected on `complete` and `cancelled`)
- `exec` requires `review` gate (cannot skip `check`)
- `merge` requires ACCEPT verdict gate (cannot skip `check post-exec`)
- `re-planning` must pass through `check` to reach `review`
- NEEDS_FIX/NEEDS_REVISION self-loops are broken by auto signal routing (`next` field)

### Annotation Format (for `plan` sub-command)

`.tmp-annotations.json` contains four `string[][]` arrays:

```json
{
  "Insert Annotations": [["Line{N}:...before20", "content", "after20..."]],
  "Delete Annotations": [["Line{N}:...before20", "selected", "after20..."]],
  "Replace Annotations": [["Line{N}:...before20", "selected", "replacement", "after20..."]],
  "Comment Annotations": [["Line{N}:...before20", "selected", "comment", "after20..."]]
}
```

| Type | Elements | Structure |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Insert | 3 | [context_before, content, context_after] |
| Delete | 3 | [context_before, selected_text, context_after] |
| Replace | 4 | [context_before, selected_text, replacement, context_after] |
| Comment | 4 | [context_before, selected_text, comment, context_after] |

Context: `context_before` = `"Line{N}:...{≤20 chars}"`, newlines as `↵`. `context_after` = `"{≤20 chars}..."`.

### depends_on Format

Supports two formats — simple string (legacy, `complete` required) and object (extended, custom minimum status):

```yaml
depends_on:
  - "auth-refactor"                           # simple: requires complete
  - { module: "api-design", min_status: "review" }  # extended: requires at least review
```

Simple string `"auth-refactor"` → `AiTasks/auth-refactor`, requires status `complete`.

Extended object `{ module, min_status }` → requires the dependency to be at **or past** `min_status` in the state machine progression: `draft` < `planning` < `review` < `executing` < `complete`. Status `blocked`, `re-planning`, `cancelled` do not satisfy any `min_status`.

**Dependency enforcement**: `exec` and `merge` MUST validate that all `depends_on` modules meet their required status before proceeding. If any dependency is not met, the sub-command rejects with a clear error listing the blocking dependencies and their current statuses. `check` also flags unmet dependencies as a blocking issue.

### Git Integration

Every task module has a dedicated git branch. Worktrees are optional for parallel execution.

#### Branch Convention

| Item | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Branch name | `task/<module-name>` | `task/auth-refactor` |
| Worktree path | `.worktrees/task-<module-name>` | `.worktrees/task-auth-refactor` |

#### Commit Message Convention

All ai-cli-task triggered commits use `--` prefix to distinguish from user manual commits:

```
-- ai-cli-task(<module>):<type> <description>
```

| type | Scenario | Commit Scope |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `init` | Task initialization | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `plan` | Plan generation / annotation processing | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `check` | Check evaluation results | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `exec` | Execution state changes | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `feat` | New feature code during exec | Project files |
| `fix` | Bugfix code during exec | Project files |
| `refactor` | Code cleanup before merge | Project files |
| `merge` | Merge to main + conflict resolution | — (merge commit) |
| `report` | Report generation | AiTasks/ directory files |
| `cancel` | Task cancellation | AiTasks/ directory files |

Examples:
```
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):init initialize task module
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):plan generate implementation plan
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):plan annotations processed
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):check post-plan PASS → review
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):feat add user auth middleware
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):fix fix token expiration check
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):exec step 2/5 done
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):check post-exec ACCEPT
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):refactor cleanup before merge
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):merge merge completed task
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):merge resolve merge conflict
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):merge task completed
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):report generate completion report
-- ai-cli-task(auth-refactor):cancel user cancelled
```

Commit scope: AiTasks/ directory files (state/plan) or project files (feat/fix).

#### Refactoring & Merge

After task completion confirmed (`check --checkpoint post-exec` ACCEPT), the `merge` sub-command handles the full merge lifecycle:

1. **Task-level refactoring** (on task branch, before merge)
2. **Merge to main** (with conflict resolution — up to 3 attempts with verification)
3. **Cleanup** (worktree removal, branch deletion)

See `skills/merge/SKILL.md` for detailed merge strategy and conflict resolution flow.

**Recommended:** After all related tasks merge to main, do a project-level refactoring pass on main (cross-task cleanup, shared utilities, API consistency). This is a manual activity, not part of auto mode.

#### Worktree Parallel Execution

Without `--worktree`: all work happens on the task branch in the main worktree. Only one task can execute at a time (branch switching required).

With `--worktree` (passed to `init`):
```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/task-<module> -b task/<module>
```

- Each task runs in an isolated directory with full project copy
- Multiple tasks can `exec` simultaneously without conflict
- `auto` daemon operates in the task's worktree directory
- On completion, merge back: `git merge task/<module>` from main branch

#### Rollback

To revert a task to a previous checkpoint:
```bash
git log --oneline task/<module>    # find checkpoint commit
git reset --hard <commit>          # in the task's worktree
```

**Warning**: `git reset --hard` is irreversible — all uncommitted changes are lost. Only use in the task's dedicated worktree, never in the main worktree (which may contain other work). Consider `git stash` first if unsure.

#### .auto-signal Convention

Every sub-command (plan, check, exec, merge, report) MUST write `.auto-signal` on completion, regardless of whether auto mode is active:

```json
{
  "step": "<sub-command>",
  "result": "<outcome>",
  "next": "<next sub-command or (stop)>",
  "checkpoint": "<checkpoint hint for next command, optional>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>"
}
```

- The `next` field follows the signal routing table documented in the `auto` sub-command.
- The `checkpoint` field provides context for the next command (e.g., `"post-plan"`, `"mid-exec"`, `"post-exec"`) when the `next` command needs it. Optional — omit when not applicable. If auto mode is not active, the file is harmless (gitignored, ephemeral). This fire-and-forget pattern avoids each skill needing to detect auto mode.
- **Atomic write**: `.auto-signal` MUST be written atomically — write to `.auto-signal.tmp` first, then `rename` to `.auto-signal`. POSIX `rename` is atomic, preventing the daemon from reading partially written JSON.

**Worktree note**: In worktree mode, `.auto-signal` MUST be written to the **main worktree's** `AiTasks/<module>/` directory (not the task worktree copy) to survive worktree removal during merge cleanup.

#### .gitignore

Add to project `.gitignore`:
```
.worktrees/
AiTasks/**/.tmp-annotations.json
AiTasks/**/.auto-signal
AiTasks/**/.auto-signal.tmp
AiTasks/**/.auto-stop
AiTasks/**/.lock
AiTasks/.experience/.lock
```

---

## Input Validation

All sub-commands that accept `<task_module>` MUST validate the path before processing:

| Check | Rule | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Path containment** | Resolved path must be under `AiTasks/` directory (no `..` traversal) | `AiTasks/../etc/passwd` → REJECT |
| **Module name** | Must match `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` (ASCII letters/digits/hyphens/underscores only) | `auth-refactor` ✓, `../../foo` ✗ |
| **No symlinks** | Task module directory must not be a symlink (prevent symlink-based escape) | REJECT if `lstat` ≠ `stat` |
| **Existence** | Directory must exist (except for `init` which creates it) | REJECT if missing |

Validation is performed by resolving the absolute path and confirming it starts with the project's `AiTasks/` prefix. This prevents path traversal attacks where a crafted module name could read/write files outside the task directory.

### Concurrency Protection

Without worktree mode, only one task should be actively operated at a time. Sub-commands that modify state (`plan`, `exec`, `check`, `merge`) MUST check for an active lockfile (`AiTasks/<module>/.lock`) before proceeding:

1. **Acquire**: Attempt to create `AiTasks/<module>/.lock` with `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` (atomic create-if-not-exists). Write `{ session, pid, timestamp }` to identify the holder
2. **If lock exists**: Read lock content, check if holding process is still alive (kill -0). If dead → remove stale lock and retry. If alive → REJECT with error identifying the holding session
3. **Release**: Delete `.lock` on sub-command completion (including error paths)
4. **Worktree mode**: Lock not required — each worktree has its own copy of AiTasks/ files
5. **Stale lock recovery**: Use rename-based recovery instead of delete+create. When detecting a stale lock (holder dead): `rename` the stale `.lock` to `.lock.stale.<pid>`, then acquire normally with `O_CREAT | O_EXCL`. If the rename fails (another process already recovered), retry from step 1. Clean up `.lock.stale.*` files after successful acquisition

### .experience/ Write Protection

`AiTasks/.experience/<type>.md` is a shared resource across tasks. When `report` writes to it (experience distillation), it MUST acquire `AiTasks/.experience/.lock` using the same lock protocol above. This prevents concurrent task completions from corrupting the experience file.

### .index.md Corruption Recovery

If `.index.md` YAML frontmatter fails to parse (malformed YAML), sub-commands MUST attempt recovery before failing:

1. **Git recovery**: `git show HEAD:AiTasks/<module>/.index.md` — restore from latest committed version
2. **If git recovery fails**: Reconstruct minimal `.index.md` with `status: draft`, `phase: ""`, preserve only what's parseable
3. **Log**: Record corruption event and recovery action in `.analysis/<date>-index-recovery.md`

### Lifecycle Hooks (Extension Point)

Status transitions can optionally trigger external notifications. If `AiTasks/.hooks.md` exists, sub-commands read it for hook configuration:

```markdown
# Lifecycle Hooks

## on_complete
<!-- Shell command or URL to call when any task reaches `complete` -->
<!-- e.g., curl -X POST https://slack.webhook/... -d '{"text":"Task ${MODULE} completed"}' -->

## on_blocked
<!-- Notification when a task becomes blocked -->
```

Hooks are **best-effort** — failures are logged but do not block the status transition. This is an optional extension; the system works without `AiTasks/.hooks.md`.

---

## Sub-commands

> Each sub-command's core logic is in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Reference material is in `skills/<name>/references/` and loaded on demand.

### Skill File Structure

```
skills/<name>/
├── SKILL.md                # Core logic: steps, state transitions, signals, git
└── references/             # On-demand reference material (loaded when needed)
    ├── task-type-*.md      # Domain-specific guidelines (plan/check/exec)
    ├── annotation-*.md     # Annotation processing details (plan)
    └── *.md                # Other reference docs
```

**Main SKILL.md** contains the workflow: prerequisites, execution steps, state transitions, git conventions, `.auto-signal` definitions, and notes. It should be self-sufficient for understanding the sub-command's behavior.

**references/** contains large reference tables and domain-specific details that are only needed in specific situations. The main SKILL.md references these files with `See references/<file>.md` directives — Claude reads them on demand when the context requires it.

### init

`/ai-cli-task init <module_name> [--title "..."] [--tags t1,t2] [--worktree]`

Create task module directory + `.index.md` (status `draft`) + `.target.md` template (domain-specific if `--type` given). Create git branch `task/<module_name>`, checkout to it (or create worktree with `--worktree`). Module name: ASCII letters/digits/hyphens/underscores (`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`).

### plan

```
/ai-cli-task plan <task_file_path> <annotation_file_path> [--silent]   # Annotation mode
/ai-cli-task plan <task_module> --generate                              # Generate mode
```

**Generate mode**: Research codebase + `.target.md` → write implementation plan `.md` file → status `planning`.

**Annotation mode**: Process `.tmp-annotations.json` (Insert/Delete/Replace/Comment) with cross-impact assessment (None/Low/Medium/High) → update task file → delete annotation file. Comments add `> 💬`/`> 📝` blockquotes, never modify existing content. REJECT on `complete`/`cancelled`.

### check

`/ai-cli-task check <task_module> [--checkpoint post-plan|mid-exec|post-exec]`

Decision maker at three lifecycle checkpoints:

| Checkpoint | Prerequisite | Outcomes |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **post-plan** | `planning` / `re-planning` | PASS→`review`, NEEDS_REVISION (no change), BLOCKED→`blocked` |
| **mid-exec** | `executing` | CONTINUE (no change), NEEDS_FIX (no change), REPLAN→`re-planning`, BLOCKED→`blocked` |
| **post-exec** | `executing` | ACCEPT (no change, signal→`merge`), NEEDS_FIX (no change), REPLAN→`re-planning` |

ACCEPT signals → `merge` sub-command for refactoring + merge. Tests MUST pass for ACCEPT.

### exec

`/ai-cli-task exec <task_module> [--step N]`

Execute implementation plan step-by-step. Prerequisite: status `review` or `executing` (NEEDS_FIX continuation). Reads plan files + `.analysis/` + `.test/`, implements changes, verifies per step against `.test/` criteria. On significant issues → signal `(mid-exec)` for mid-exec evaluation. On all steps complete → signal `(done)` for post-exec verification. Project file commits use `feat`/`fix` type.

### merge

`/ai-cli-task merge <task_module>`

Merge completed task branch to main with automated conflict resolution. Prerequisite: status `executing` with ACCEPT verdict. Performs pre-merge refactoring, attempts merge (up to 3 conflict resolution retries with build/test verification), post-merge cleanup (worktree + branch). On persistent conflict → stays `executing` (retryable after manual resolution).

### report

`/ai-cli-task report <task_module> [--format full|summary]`

Generate `.report.md` from all task artifacts. Informational only — no status change. For `complete` tasks, includes change history via commit message pattern matching (works after branch deletion). Full format: Summary, Objective, Plan, Changes, Verification, Issues, Dependencies, Lessons.

### auto

`/ai-cli-task auto <task_module> [--start|--stop|--status]`

Single-session autonomous loop: plan → check → exec → check, with self-correction. A single Claude session internally orchestrates all steps; the backend daemon monitors progress via `fs.watch` on `.auto-signal` and enforces safety limits.

**Status-based first entry:**

| Status | First Action |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Validate `.target.md` has content → plan --generate (stop if empty) |
| `planning` | check --checkpoint post-plan |
| `re-planning` | Read `phase`: `needs-plan` → plan --generate; `needs-check` → check --checkpoint post-plan; empty → plan --generate (safe default) |
| `review` | exec |
| `executing` | check --checkpoint post-exec |
| `complete` | report → stop |
| `blocked` / `cancelled` | stop |

**Signal-based subsequent routing** (`next` field breaks self-loops):

| step | result | next | checkpoint |
|------|--------|------|------------|
| check | PASS | exec | — |
| check | NEEDS_REVISION | plan | — |
| check | CONTINUE | exec | — |
| check | ACCEPT | merge | — |
| check | NEEDS_FIX | exec | mid-exec / post-exec |
| check | REPLAN / BLOCKED | plan / (stop) | — |
| plan | (any) | check | post-plan |
| exec | (done) | check | post-exec |
| exec | (mid-exec) | check | mid-exec |
| exec | (step-N) | check | mid-exec | ← manual `--step N` only |
| exec | (blocked) | (stop) | — |
| merge | success | report | — |

**Safety**: max iterations (default 20), timeout (default 30 min), stop on `blocked`, one auto per session (SQLite PK), one auto per task (UNIQUE).

### cancel

`/ai-cli-task cancel <task_module> [--reason "..."] [--cleanup]`

Cancel any non-terminal task → `cancelled`. Rejected on `complete`/`cancelled`. Stops auto if running. Snapshots uncommitted changes before cancelling. With `--cleanup`, removes worktree + deletes branch. Without `--cleanup`, branch preserved for reference.
