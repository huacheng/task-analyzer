# /ai-cli-task auto — Autonomous Execution Loop

Coordinate the full task lifecycle autonomously: plan → check → exec → check, with self-correction on failures. Runs as a **single Claude session** that internally dispatches sub-commands, preserving context across all steps.

## Usage

```
/ai-cli-task auto <task_module_path> [--start|--stop|--status]
```

## Architecture

Auto mode runs as a **single long-lived Claude session** that internally loops through sub-commands. The backend daemon starts the session and monitors it externally; it does NOT dispatch individual commands.

### Why Single Session

| Aspect | Multi-session (old) | Single session (current) |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Context | Lost between steps, rebuilt from `.summary.md` | Naturally shared across all steps |
| Token cost | Re-read files each step, duplicate context loading | Read once, incrementally update |
| Coherence | Each step is blind to implicit decisions | Claude remembers why it made choices |
| Latency | Shell prompt wait + Claude startup per step | Zero inter-step overhead |
| Daemon complexity | Command construction + dispatch + readiness check | Just monitoring + stop signal |

### Signal File (`.auto-signal`)

After each sub-command step completes, Claude writes a progress signal to the task module. This is a **monitoring report** for the daemon, NOT a dispatch trigger:

```json
{
  "step": "check",
  "result": "PASS",
  "next": "exec",
  "checkpoint": "",
  "iteration": 3,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Fields:
- `step`: the sub-command that just completed
- `result`: outcome of the step
- `next`: what Claude will execute next (or `"(stop)"`)
- `checkpoint`: context hint (e.g., `"post-plan"`, `"mid-exec"`, `"post-exec"`). Empty when not applicable
- `iteration`: current iteration count (for daemon progress tracking). **Auto-mode only** — absent when sub-commands write `.auto-signal` in manual execution
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601

The daemon reads this via `fs.watch` to:
1. Update progress display (iteration count, current step, elapsed time)
2. Check iteration limit (`iteration >= maxIterations` → write `.auto-stop`)
3. Check timeout (`elapsed >= timeoutMinutes` → write `.auto-stop`)
4. Update `last_signal_at` in SQLite for stall detection baseline

The daemon does **NOT** construct or send commands based on the signal.

### Stop File (`.auto-stop`)

The daemon writes `.auto-stop` to the task module directory to request graceful termination. Claude checks for this file before each iteration:

```json
{
  "reason": "timeout",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:30:00Z"
}
```

Reasons: `"timeout"`, `"max_iterations"`, `"user_stop"`, `"stall_limit"`

### Signal Validation

The daemon validates `.auto-signal` fields for monitoring integrity:

| Field | Validation | Allowed Values |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| `step` | Whitelist | `plan`, `check`, `exec`, `merge`, `report` |
| `result` | Whitelist | `PASS`, `NEEDS_REVISION`, `ACCEPT`, `NEEDS_FIX`, `REPLAN`, `BLOCKED`, `CONTINUE`, `(generated)`, `(annotations)`, `(done)`, `(mid-exec)`, `(step-N)` (where N is integer), `(blocked)`, `success`, `conflict` |
| `next` | Whitelist | `plan`, `check`, `exec`, `merge`, `report`, `(stop)` |
| `checkpoint` | Whitelist | `""`, `post-plan`, `mid-exec`, `post-exec` |
| `iteration` | Integer | ≥ 0 |
| `timestamp` | Format check | ISO 8601 |

Invalid signals are logged but do not affect Claude's internal loop (daemon is observer, not dispatcher).

### Stall Detection & Recovery

Claude Code may stall mid-execution. The daemon detects stalls via heartbeat polling (60s interval, 3 consecutive unchanged captures = suspected stall) and recovers via pattern matching (continuation prompts, y/n prompts, shell prompt restart). Recovery limits: 3 per iteration, 10 total.

> **See `references/stall-detection.md`** for the full heartbeat polling logic, stall determination rules, pattern matching recovery table, and recovery limits.

### Context Window Management & Quota Handling

Proactive `/compact` at >= 70% context usage prevents overflow. `.summary.md` files provide compaction recovery context. Quota exhaustion is NOT a stall — daemon enters quota-wait mode with timeout clock paused.

> **See `references/context-quota.md`** for the full context management strategy, quota exhaustion handling (daemon + Claude behavior), and SQLite `quota_wait_since` extension.

## State Machine

```
AUTO LOOP (4 phases — all within single Claude session)

Phase 1: Planning
  plan ──→ check(post-plan) ─── PASS ──────────→ [Phase 2]
                │
                NEEDS_REVISION ──→ plan (retry)

Phase 2: Execution
  exec ─┬─ (mid-exec) ──→ check(mid-exec) ─── CONTINUE ──→ exec (resume)
        │                         │
        │                    NEEDS_FIX ──→ exec (fix then resume)
        │                         │
        │                    REPLAN ──→ [Phase 1]
        │
        └─ (done) ──→ [Phase 3]

Phase 3: Verification
  check(post-exec) ─── ACCEPT ──→ [Phase 4]
          │                │
       NEEDS_FIX        REPLAN ──→ [Phase 1]
          │
          └──→ exec (re-exec) → [Phase 3]

Phase 4: Merge & Report
  merge ─── success ──→ report → (stop)
    │
    └── conflict unresolvable (after 3 retries, stays executing) → (stop)

Terminal: BLOCKED at any check → (stop, status → blocked)
Terminal: merge conflict → (stop, status stays executing — retryable)
```

## Internal Loop Logic

The auto skill runs this loop within a single Claude session:

```
1. Read .index.md → determine entry point (status-based routing)
2. LOOP:
   a. Check for .auto-stop file → if exists, break loop
   b. Context check: if context window usage ≥ 70%, run /compact to compress context
   c. Execute current step (plan/check/exec/merge/report logic per SKILL.md)
      — SKIP the sub-command's own .auto-signal write step (auto loop handles it below)
   d. Evaluate result → determine next step (result-based routing)
   e. Write .auto-signal (progress report for daemon, WITH iteration field)
   f. Increment iteration counter
   g. If next == "(stop)" → break loop
   h. Set current step = next step → continue loop
3. Cleanup: delete .auto-signal, report final status
```

**Signal ownership in auto mode**: Each sub-command's SKILL.md includes a "write `.auto-signal`" step. In auto mode, the auto loop **subsumes** that step — Claude writes the signal once at step 2d (with the `iteration` field included). The sub-command's own signal-write instruction is skipped to avoid double-writing. In manual (non-auto) execution, sub-commands write `.auto-signal` themselves (without `iteration` field).

### Entry Point (Status-Based Routing)

| Current Status | First Step |
|----------------|-----------|
| `draft` | Validate `.target.md` has substantive content (not just template placeholders) → if empty, stop and report "fill `.target.md` first". Otherwise execute plan (generate mode) |
| `planning` | Execute check (post-plan) |
| `review` | Execute exec |
| `executing` | Execute check (post-exec) |
| `re-planning` | Read `phase` field: if `needs-plan` → execute plan (generate); if `needs-check` → execute check (post-plan); if empty → default to plan (generate, safe fallback) |
| `complete` | Execute report, then stop |
| `blocked` | Stop loop, report blocking reason |
| `cancelled` | Stop loop |

### Result-Based Routing

After each step, Claude evaluates the result and determines the next step internally:

| step | result | next | checkpoint | Rationale |
|------|--------|------|------------|-----------|
| check | PASS | exec | — | Plan approved, proceed to execution |
| check | NEEDS_REVISION | plan | — | Plan needs revision, re-generate first |
| check | ACCEPT | merge | — | Task verified, merge to main |
| check | NEEDS_FIX | exec | mid-exec / post-exec | Minor issues, re-execute to fix first |
| check | REPLAN | plan | — | Fundamental issues, revise plan |
| check | BLOCKED | (stop) | — | Cannot continue |
| check (mid-exec) | CONTINUE | exec | — | Progress OK, resume execution |
| check (mid-exec) | NEEDS_FIX | exec | mid-exec | Fixable issues, exec addresses then continues |
| check (mid-exec) | REPLAN | plan | — | Fundamental issues, revise plan |
| check (mid-exec) | BLOCKED | (stop) | — | Cannot continue |
| plan | (any) | check | post-plan | Plan ready, assess it |
| exec | (done) | check | post-exec | All steps completed, verify results |
| exec | (mid-exec) | check | mid-exec | Significant issue encountered, checkpoint |
| exec | (blocked) | (stop) | — | Cannot continue |
| merge | success | report | — | Merge complete, generate report |
| merge | conflict | (stop) | — | Merge conflict unresolvable |
| report | (any) | (stop) | — | Loop complete |

### Context Advantage

Because all steps run in one session, Claude naturally retains:
- Plan decisions and trade-offs from the planning phase
- Check feedback and evaluation rationale
- Implementation details and workarounds from execution
- Error context from previous fix attempts

The `.summary.md` file is still written by each sub-command as a **compaction safety net** — if the context window overflows and compaction occurs, `.summary.md` provides the condensed recovery context. But during normal auto execution, live conversation context is the primary source of truth.

**Compaction recovery**: If context compaction occurs mid-loop, Claude loses the iteration counter and current step position. To recover:
1. Read `.auto-signal` — the `iteration` field gives the last completed iteration count; `step` and `next` give the position in the loop
2. Read `.index.md` — status confirms the current lifecycle phase
3. Read `.summary.md` — condensed task context from the last sub-command
4. Resume the loop from `next` step at `iteration + 1`

## Backend REST API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/:id/task-auto` | Start auto mode for a task module |
| `DELETE` | `/api/sessions/:id/task-auto` | Stop auto mode (writes `.auto-stop`) |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/:id/task-auto` | Get auto mode status |
| `GET` | `/api/task-auto/lookup?taskDir=<path>` | Look up which session is running auto for a given task directory. Returns `{ session_name, status }` or 404 if not found. Used by `cancel` to find the correct session to stop |

Request body for POST:
```json
{
  "taskDir": "/absolute/path/to/AiTasks/module-name",
  "maxIterations": 20,
  "timeoutMinutes": 30
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `taskDir` | string | (required) | Absolute path to task module in **main worktree** (e.g., `/project/AiTasks/auth-refactor`). In worktree mode, this is still the main worktree path — NOT the task worktree path. Daemon's `fs.watch` monitors this path for `.auto-signal` |
| `maxIterations` | number | 20 | Max plan/check/exec cycles before forced stop |
| `timeoutMinutes` | number | 30 | Total execution time limit (minutes). User sets based on task difficulty |

Frontend displays these as editable fields in the auto-start dialog, with sensible defaults.

### Daemon Startup Sequence

When `POST /api/sessions/:id/task-auto` is called:

1. **Validate**: check no active auto loop for this session or task_dir
2. **Insert** `task_auto` row into SQLite
3. **Send** `claude "/ai-cli-task auto <taskDir>"` to the session's PTY
4. **Start** `fs.watch` on `taskDir` for `.auto-signal` changes
5. **Start** heartbeat polling timer (60s interval)

The daemon does NOT send any further commands after step 3. Claude's internal loop handles all subsequent orchestration.

### SQLite State

```sql
CREATE TABLE task_auto (
  session_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  task_dir TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'running',
  max_iterations INTEGER DEFAULT 20,
  timeout_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 30,
  iteration_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  recovery_count_step INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  recovery_count_total INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_capture_hash TEXT DEFAULT '',
  stall_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  quota_wait_since TEXT DEFAULT '',
  started_at TEXT,
  last_signal_at TEXT
);
```

`session_name` as PRIMARY KEY enforces one auto loop per session. Starting a new auto task requires stopping the current one or creating a new session.

`status` column values: `running` (active loop) → row deleted on stop. The row only exists while the auto loop is active; cleanup removes it entirely. The `status` column exists for recovery: if the server crashes before cleanup, stale rows with `status = 'running'` are detected on restart (see Server Recovery).

## Safety

- **Max iterations**: user-configurable (default 20), daemon writes `.auto-stop` when reached
- **Timeout**: user-configurable (default 30 min), daemon writes `.auto-stop` when elapsed
- **Stall detection**: heartbeat polling (60s) + pattern matching recovery, with per-iteration (3) and total (10) recovery limits
- **Context management**: proactive `/compact` at ≥ 70% context window usage, with `.summary.md` as compaction safety net
- **Quota exhaustion**: detected and handled as wait (not stall), timeout clock paused during quota-wait
- **Pause on blocked**: Auto stops immediately on `blocked` status (Claude's internal loop exits)
- **Manual override**: User can `/ai-cli-task auto --stop` at any time, or daemon writes `.auto-stop` via `DELETE` API
- **Graceful stop**: Claude checks for `.auto-stop` before each iteration, ensuring clean exit between steps (not mid-step)
- **Single instance per session**: Only one auto loop per session (enforced by SQLite PK). If an auto task is already running, `POST` returns 409 Conflict
- **Single instance per task**: UNIQUE constraint on `task_dir` prevents same task from running in multiple sessions

## Frontend Integration

The frontend is a **pure observer** for auto mode, except for start/stop control:

- **Start dialog**: editable fields for `maxIterations` and `timeoutMinutes` with defaults
- **Status display**: polls `GET /api/sessions/:id/task-auto`, shows in Plan panel toolbar:
  - Current iteration / max iterations
  - Elapsed time / timeout
  - Current step (from latest `.auto-signal`)
  - Running / stopped status
- **Stop button**: sends `DELETE /api/sessions/:id/task-auto` (daemon writes `.auto-stop`)
- Does NOT drive the loop — Claude's internal loop handles all orchestration

## Cleanup

When auto mode stops (complete, blocked, cancelled, or manual stop), cleanup is split between Claude and the daemon:

**Claude-side** (inside the session, at loop exit):
1. Delete `.auto-signal` file if exists
2. Delete `.auto-stop` file if exists (consumed, no longer needed)

**Daemon-side** (backend, after detecting loop exit or stop):
1. Stop heartbeat polling timer
2. Stop `fs.watch` on task directory
3. Remove `task_auto` row from SQLite (clears all stall detection state)
4. Frontend status indicator clears on next poll

The daemon detects loop exit by: (a) receiving a `DELETE` API call (user stop), (b) heartbeat detecting shell prompt (Claude exited), or (c) `.auto-signal` with `next: "(stop)"` (natural completion). In all cases, daemon performs its cleanup steps above.

## Git

Auto mode inherits git behavior from each sub-command it invokes. No additional git commits are made by auto itself — each plan, check, exec, merge, and report step handles its own state commits on the task branch.

## Server Recovery

On backend server restart, auto state is recovered from SQLite:

1. **Read** all `task_auto` rows with `status = 'running'`
2. **For each active row**:
   a. **Delete stale `.auto-stop`** if exists in `task_dir` (prevents restarted Claude from immediately exiting due to leftover stop file from pre-crash state)
   b. Check terminal state via `tmux capture-pane`:
      - If Claude auto session still running → re-establish monitoring (fs.watch + heartbeat)
      - If shell prompt visible (Claude exited) → restart: send `claude "/ai-cli-task auto <task_dir>"` to PTY (Claude's internal loop reads `.index.md` to determine resume point)
   c. Reset `stall_count` to `0` and `last_capture_hash` to `""` (fresh monitoring baseline)
   d. Start heartbeat polling timer
   e. Re-establish `fs.watch` on `task_dir` for `.auto-signal`
3. **Resume** normal daemon operation (signal watching + heartbeat polling)

On restart, Claude's auto loop re-reads `.index.md` and `.summary.md` to reconstruct context. The conversation context from the previous session is lost, but `.summary.md` provides the condensed recovery information.

## Notes

- Auto mode starts with a single `claude "/ai-cli-task auto <module>"` CLI invocation; all subsequent steps execute within that same session
- The daemon's only active intervention is writing `.auto-stop`; all other daemon activity is passive monitoring
- `.auto-signal` and `.auto-stop` are transient files — should be in `.gitignore`
- The daemon logs all signal events and stall detections to server console for debugging
- **Known trade-off**: First entry on `executing` status always runs `check --checkpoint post-exec`. If execution was incomplete (`completed_steps` < total), check will detect this and route back to exec via NEEDS_FIX, adding one extra iteration. This is acceptable because the auto skill does not re-parse plan files to count total steps at entry
- **Context window overflow**: If Claude's context compacts during a long auto run, `.summary.md` (written by each sub-command) provides recovery context. The auto loop continues normally after compaction — each sub-command re-reads relevant files as specified in its SKILL.md
