## Plugins

### ai-cli-task

Structured task lifecycle management with 8 sub-commands. Git-integrated branch-per-task workflow with worktree support, annotation-driven planning, and autonomous execution loop.

```
/ai-cli-task <subcommand> [args]
```

#### Sub-commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `init` | Create task module — directory, `.index.md`, git branch, optional worktree |
| `plan` | Generate implementation plan from `.target.md`, or process frontend annotations |
| `check` | Decision gate at 3 checkpoints: post-plan, mid-exec, post-exec |
| `exec` | Execute plan step-by-step with per-step verification |
| `merge` | Merge task branch to main with conflict resolution (up to 3 retries) |
| `report` | Generate completion report + distill experience to knowledge base |
| `auto` | Autonomous loop: plan → check → exec → merge → report |
| `cancel` | Cancel task, optionally cleanup worktree and branch |

#### Task Lifecycle

```
draft → planning → review → executing → complete
                ↗            ↘
         re-planning    ←    blocked
```

Every task lives in a `TASK/<module>/` directory with structured metadata, and runs on a dedicated `task/<module>` git branch.

#### Features

- **State machine** — 8 statuses with validated transitions, no deadlocks
- **Git integration** — branch-per-task, worktree isolation for parallel execution
- **Annotation-driven** — frontend Plan panel annotations (Insert/Delete/Replace/Comment) processed into plan updates
- **Auto mode** — single-session autonomous orchestration with stall detection, context quota management, and safety limits
- **Multi-domain** — 17+ task types (software, image-processing, video-production, DSP, literary, screenwriting, science, mechatronics, ai-skill, ...)
- **Experience KB** — lessons from completed tasks distilled to `TASK/.experience/` for cross-task learning
- **Concurrency protection** — lockfile-based mutual exclusion with stale lock recovery

## Installation

```bash
# Add marketplace source
/plugin marketplace add huacheng/moonview

# Install plugin
/plugin install ai-cli-task@moonview
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize a task
/ai-cli-task init auth-refactor --title "Refactor auth to JWT"

# 2. Write requirements in TASK/auth-refactor/.target.md, then generate plan
/ai-cli-task plan auth-refactor --generate

# 3. Review plan quality
/ai-cli-task check auth-refactor --checkpoint post-plan

# 4. Execute the plan
/ai-cli-task exec auth-refactor

# 5. Verify completion
/ai-cli-task check auth-refactor --checkpoint post-exec

# 6. Merge to main
/ai-cli-task merge auth-refactor

# 7. Generate report
/ai-cli-task report auth-refactor

# Or run the full lifecycle automatically:
/ai-cli-task auto auth-refactor --start
```
